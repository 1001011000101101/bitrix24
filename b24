Install Composer (Phar fix) PHP Version 7.4.28:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22047487/how-do-i-install-enable-the-php-phar-extension

You can modify your php.ini (/etc/php.ini) file to get this working. (Some hosts use a phprc file to enable different settings in PHP instead of php.ini. @jerrygarciuh On dreamhost, follow the directions here)

After you have added your php.ini/phprc file, add these lines to the file (just the first line if your server doesn't use Suhosin for security):

extension = phar.so 
suhosin.executor.include.whitelist = phar

I am using CentOS and had same problem.

I changed /usr/local/bin/composer to /usr/bin/composer and it worked.

Run below command :

curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php 
 sudo mv composer.phar /usr/bin/composer

Verify Composer is installed or not

composer --version
